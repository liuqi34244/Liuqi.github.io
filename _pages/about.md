My name is Liu Qi, a junior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). Currently in my third academic year, I have built a solid foundational knowledge system in core computer disciplines including data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, operating systems and programming languages, and have accumulated practical experience in programming and small-scale project development through coursework and independent practice. I am highly motivated to explore in-depth research directions such as artificial intelligence, software engineering and computer application technology, and am actively looking for opportunities to participate in scientific research projects and practical innovation activities to further improve my professional competence and research literacy.
For academic communication and cooperation, my school email address is u202315662@hust.edu.cn. I am willing to communicate and learn with peers and teachers in related fields, and continuously enrich my academic experience and practical ability in mutual exchange.
